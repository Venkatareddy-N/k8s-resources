Static Provisioning
====================
EBS
---
1. Create volume manually 
volume id : vol-0f41d920c840991da

2. we need to install the drivers

ebs csi driver

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/install.md  --> find link here

kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.36"  --> drivers link 

kubectl get pods -n kube-system --> here is running admin related pods.

3. EKS nodes should have permissions to access EBS volumes.

we have one iam role attached to the ec2 instances, to that iam attach a policy 
AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy

---------------------

persistant volume and persistant volume claim (PV, PVC)

K8 created a wrapper objets to manage underlying volumes, because k8 engineer will not have full idea on volumes.

PV --> it represents tha physical storage like EBS/EFS
